FTS 2018 is the 4th edition of the FTS workshop series, organized in conjunction with the 2018
IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (Cluster 2018).

Fault Tolerance is a cross-cutting issue that spans all layers of the hardware/software stack,
and hence, requires coupled improvements in each layer and co-design between the different layers.
FTS aims at providing a venue for researchers to share experiences across the hardware/software
layers and attendees to get a holistic view of fault tolerance techniques, especially with a
focus on HPC and parallel computing.
